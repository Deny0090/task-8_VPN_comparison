Protonvpn 

There are paid versions available but I use the free version
You will need to install app depending on your OS - Windows, linux, android, IOS . 

We need to create a account and after downloading the app you have to put in your username and password 

Connect to Server 
 
Limitation with the free trial we can connect to 5 countries server 
 

After you have started this VPN service you'll see your ip address has changed 

Verify your ip address 

I visited whatismyipaddress.com to verify that my ip had changed. I included some screenshots 

Corroborate Traffic Encryption 

I visited google.com the lock pad icon shows that the connection secure 
and visited https://www.dnsleaktest.com/ to check a dns leak the leak is when your ISP could see your browsing in spite of the VPN.
For more packet inception use wireshark to analyze the traffic 

Disconnect VPN & compare 

I used the speed test on https://www.speedtest.net/ before and after using the vpn as well
*VPN is slow speed due to encryption overhead* 

7. Research VPN Encryption & Privacy 

Encryption 

AES-256 – Military-grade (best for security).

WireGuard – Fast & secure (modern choice).

OpenVPN – Trusted but slower. 

Privacy Features 

No logs policy (audited = trustworthy).

Kill switch (prevents leaks if VPN drops).

DNS leak protection (hides browsing from ISP). 

 Risks

Free VPNs may log/sell data.

WebRTC leaks can expose your real IP.

Some countries block VPNs (use obfuscated servers).
